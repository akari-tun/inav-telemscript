# inav-telemscript
Just a rewrite of an existing telemetry script which does IFR like display on a Taranis, to work with inav, crossfire and open-tx 2.2.x

Install is a case of putting BMP folder and incrsf.lua in /SCRIPTS/TELEMTRY on your SD card and setting one of your telemetry screens to a script and selecting incrsf.
